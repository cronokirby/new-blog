[Live](https://cronokirby.github.io/peerbin/#/).
This project provides a version of websites like pastebin, or hastebin, except without
a central server to store the files; instead users send the files to eachother
via [webtorrent](https://webtorrent.io/). *Elm* is used for the main
UI components, and *Javascript* to glue this code with the webtorrent part.
