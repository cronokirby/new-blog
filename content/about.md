This is a blog I try to contribute to regularly.
I post about functional programming, networking, and
other good stuff.

I'm Lúcás, and I've been programming for 2 years or so.
I try and wet my toes in a lot of different things, and I try to program
in the languages I've used the least.

Cats are not only my favorite animal, but objectively the best pet.
