(Or: knowing what you know is half the battle).

## Omakase

You might have heard the term "omakase" before. This refers to a style of sushi restaurant / service,
where the chef selects a sequence of dishes that make up your meal. As a customer, you don't order any of these dishes,
but rather the omakase as a whole. Trusting the chef is part of the deal, if not one of its main benefits.

This might seem a bit esoteric, but up-scale restaurants operate similarly with how they arrange courses. Usually you have
a limited selection of courses, and each course consists of a rigid set of dishes. The dishes composing a course have been
selected specifically by a chef.

This has a few nice properties, for me at least:

For one, I can be confident in the meal. If the chef has selected a specific set of dishes, I can be pretty sure
that those dishes go well together, and I trust the chef to make those dishes well individually, of course.
It removes a great deal of cognitive load, since I don't need to worry about what
to pick to drink, as an entr√©e, as a dessert, etc. I only have to make the initial choice of
which course to go with. And in the case of sushi, I don't have to make any choices at all. From the beginning,
my fate is entirely in the hands of chef.

I'm not a great chef, nor much of a cook to begin with, so going to a nice restaurant removes quite a bit of burden
from my shoulders. I generally have better culinary experiences in restaurants than I do at home, safe to say.

## Textbooks

Textbooks are kind of like going out to eat in a nice restaurant. First comes the choice of
the restaurant, and then the choice of the course, and then the course is given to you in
a nice linear fashion. For textbooks, first you have to pick the field or area of study, then
you can pick a specific textbook to use, and then after that, the presentation of the material
is given to you in a nice linear fashion.

Textbooks share a lot of the advantages of curation that omakase and courses do.

If I trust the textbook, I can be confident that it presents the material in well organised way,
likely better organised than if I had tried and assemble the various "dishes" together myself.
For example, a good textbook on algorithms can present a well focused overview of the subject,
which can be a much better academic experience than trudging through the weeds on your own.

## Courses

In the same vein as textbooks, you have *academic* courses. In some sense, these are like
*interactive* textbooks. When you take a course on some subject, you obviously can't go into
the full depth or breadth of that subject. Instead, you go through a selected path through some interesting
points in that subject. You have the benefit of a teacher giving you live lectures, as well as coursework,
and usually some form of examination to make sure that you can demonstrate some knowledge of what you're
supposed to have learned.

# Curation

All of these are examples of **curation**. I could give more examples, but I wanted to
get to the idea of curation in learning relatively quickly. The common thread through
all of these examples is that someone else has taken care of assembling the path you're
taking, and you reap the benefits of that work when following their guidance.

## What I like about it

Curation is like riding on a train. You choose which train to take, so you know where you're going,
but more often than not, the path to your destination isn't known, and neither are the various
sights you'll see along the way. Of course, the person who set up that train line has carefully
thought about the how to navigate the rolling hills, how to lay the tracks, and even how to place
the seats inside the train itself.

When you're learning a new topic, you should know less about that topic than the people teaching it
to you indirectly or directly. If you knew more than them, what would you be doing learning from
them anyways? Because of this, it makes tentative sense to also trust them to designate a good path
through the landscape they know so well. Who better to figure out what to include in a course than
someone deeply acquainted with the field that course is in?

Another great aspect we haven't touched on yet is prerequisites. One great thing about
a course is that (assuming you have enough background knowledge, we'll get to that later), you
can start at the beginning of the course, and at each step along the way, you're building on knowledge
you gained through the same course. Because of this, you're never missing any piece of the puzzle. Each
step you take can be made given everything you've worked at prior. This is one of the hardest things
to replicate when researching a topic independently, and one of the reasons I like using textbooks so much.
If I can grok the beginning of a well organised textbook, I can be more or less assured that I can work
through the rest.
