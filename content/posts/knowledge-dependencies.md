(Or: knowing what you know is half the battle).

# Curation is great

You might have heard the term "omakase" before. This refers to a style of sushi restaurant / service,
where the chef selects a sequence of dishes that make up your meal. As a customer, you don't order any of these dishes,
but rather the omakase as a whole. Trusting the chef is part of the deal, if not one of its main benefits.

This might seem a bit esoteric, but up-scale restaurants operate similarly with how they arrange courses. Usually you have
a limited selection of courses, and each course consists of a rigid set of dishes. The dishes composing a course have been
selected specifically by a chef.
